# Ultra Slow Scan TV
An SSTV Mode that can be used on any noisy frequency band, even the 8kHz Dreamer's band!

Just unzip the two files (encoder) and (decoder), and follow the Usage.txt files to propery use USSTV!
If you have any issues, feel free to contact me at blenderbach@gmail.com
If you'd like to show me some encodings you've done or received from other users via radio-waves, feel free to send an email as well! 

Enjoy!
:)
